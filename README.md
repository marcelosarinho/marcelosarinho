# Hello! I'm Marcelo Sarinho.

## About me
I'm a Front-End Developer who started programming in 2021, and since then, I've fell in love with it. My main focus right now is to become a Full-Stack Developer in the web development area and contribute to Open-Source Projects. I'm 21, and I live in Brazil.
